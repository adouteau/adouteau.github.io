I'm Antoine Douteau, PhD Student of the [GREYC](https://www.greyc.fr/) Laboratory in Caen, France since October 2024. I'm part of the [AMACC](https://www.greyc.fr/equipes/amacc/) team under the supervision of [Adeline Roux-Langlois](https://langloi227.users.greyc.fr/index.html). I achieved a [Master's degree in Cryptology and Cybersecurity](https://mastercsi.labri.fr/) from the University of Bordeaux in 2024. 

I'm mainly interested in lattice-based cryptography and zero-knowledge proof. In particular, studying security proofs over new (relaxed) lattice-based assumptions, I did an internship focused on the use of the [Hint-MLWE](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-38554-4_18) assumption to complete a rejection-free framework of PoK. 

More about me, I like cycling, badminton, theater and video games. I'm also fascinated by experimental and techno music techniques.
